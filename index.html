	<h2>ABOUT</h2>

	

<p>Billie Eilish (born December 18, 2001, Los Angeles, California, U.S.) first gained recognition in 2015 for the song <b><i>“Ocean Eyes”</i></b> and became, in 2020, <b><i>the youngest person ever to win a Grammy for album of the year, for When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?</i></b> Her other works include Happier than Ever (2021) and <b><i>the award-winning song “What Was I Made For?</i></b>,” which was recorded for the Barbie (2023) soundtrack.
Eilish’s parents were inspired by Hanson, a ’90s pop band formed by a group of homeschooled brothers from Tulsa, Oklahoma, to teach their children at home and encourage them to explore passions outside of the traditional education system. As a child, Eilish experimented with horseback riding, dance, and singing as a member of the Los Angeles Children’s Chorus. In 2015 Eilish’s elder brother, Finneas Baird O’Connell, who performs under the moniker <b><i>FINNEAS</i></b>, enlisted her to sing <i>“Ocean Eyes,”</i> a song he had written and produced for his band at the time and later put online. The song quickly gained success, and Eilish signed with the boutique label Darkroom in the summer of 2016.
<b><i>Darkroom released Eilish’s Don’t Smile at Me in August 2017</i></b>, an eight-song EP <i>written by Eilish and FINNEAS.</i> The EP was reissued with a bonus track in December 2017; two more bonus tracks were added in later reissues. Following its release, Don’t Smile at Me peaked at 14 on the Billboard 200 chart.
